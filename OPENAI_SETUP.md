# üîë Setting Up OpenAI API Key for Live AI Questions

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Get your OpenAI API Key:**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up/login to your OpenAI account
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`)

2. **Add your API key to the .env file:**
   - Open `/garudaco/backend/.env` 
   - Replace `your_actual_openai_api_key_here` with your real API key
   - Example: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abcd1234efgh5678...`

3. **Restart the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/garuda/Documents/workspace/prac/garudaco/backend
   ./venv/bin/python3 app.py
   ```

## Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Environment Variable (Terminal)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
cd /home/garuda/Documents/workspace/prac/garudaco/backend
./venv/bin/python3 app.py
```

### Method 2: Direct Code Modification (Less Secure)
Edit `app.py` line 22:
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"  # Replace with your key
```

## What Changes After Setup

### Before (Mock Responses):
- Questions are pre-written dummy content
- Same questions appear repeatedly
- Basic multiple choice options

### After (Real AI):
- Fresh questions generated for each topic
- Questions tailored to your specific topic/difficulty
- Varied question types (MCQ, coding, fill-in-blanks)
- Context-aware difficulty adjustment
- More sophisticated explanations

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use the `.env` file method (already set up)
- Keep your API key private
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Commit your API key to version control
- Share your API key publicly
- Hardcode the key in your source code

## Verify It's Working

1. After adding your API key and restarting
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/assessment
3. Generate a new assessment
4. You should see fresh, unique questions generated by OpenAI

## Cost Information

- OpenAI charges per token used
- Typical question generation costs ~$0.01-0.05 per question
- Monitor usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1. Check your API key is valid
2. Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account
3. Check the terminal for error messages
4. Verify the backend restarted successfully
